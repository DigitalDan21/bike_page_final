    <h1>Basic Motorcycle Modification</h1>
    <h2>In this article, you will learn about the basics of what you can do to increase the performance of your motorcycle as well as what you can do at home and what is better left to a professional.</h2>

      <section>
        <p>Many of the modifications mentioned in this article hold true for both street and off-road bikes. However the way these modifications are tuned will depend on the type of riding you do.</p>
      </section>

    <h1>Types of riding</h1>
    <h2>First and foremost lets go over what the different types of riding are and what motorcycles are best used for each type of riding</h2>
    <ol>
    <section>
   <!--TODO: add images-->
        <li><h1>Off-Road</h1></li>
        <p>Off-Road riding can be broken down into three major categories,all of which require slightly different dirtbikes and are more enjoyable with a bike specifically set up for that type of riding.
            <ul>
                <li>Hard Enduro</li>
                <p>Hard Enduro involves a lot of highly technical manouvers paired with delicate throttle, clutch, and brake control. Expect to crash a lot </p>
                <li>single-track</li>
                <p>single track while similar to hard enduro is significantly less techincal, its typically going to be faster paced than hard enduro and has a lot more "flow" to it</p>
                <li>Trials</li>
                <p>Trials is going to be the most techique based riding you can do on a motorcycle, it is typically done on a Trials specific bike that has nowhere to sit down on as it is not meant to be used at speed, rather it is designed to jump over gaps and obstacles</p>
            </ul>
        </p>
</section>
<!-- TODO:add images-->
    <section>
    <li><h1>Dualsport</h1></li>
    <p>Dualsport will be the most versatile style of riding. A true Jack of all master of none. While Dualsport bikes are capable of both highway cruising and any form of enduro, they are definitly going to be a lot more at home in an off-road setting.
       Soley due to the fact that Dualsport motorcycles are essentially dirtbikes with made street legal with headlights, taillight and a lisence plate.  </p>

</section>

    <section>
    <li><h1>Adventure</h1></li>
<p>Adventure bikes are akin to dualsports but are typically going to be large displacement bikes that will be much better for highway cruising and long distance hauls.
    Adventure bikes are generally a lot heavier and less off-road capable than dualsports, however are capable of some single track riding is required. One exception to this is going to be the Yamaha Tenere 700, which in my opinion is a perfect swiss army knife bike.
</p>

    <!-- TODO:add images-->
    <li><h1>Touring</h1></li>
<p>Touring bikes are similar to Adventure bikes but a lot more street oriented. Fat rear tire, with comfortable rider geometry make them exceptional for long distance travel with a lot of gear. 
    the biggest difference between the Touring category and Adventure category are going to be the tires and suspension. a prime example of a touring motorcycle is the BMW S1000XR. 
    big engine, lots of power, but is still a very comfortable ride and capable of going through some less than ideal terrain. </p>

   <!-- TODO:add images-->
    <li><h1>Street</h1></li>
<p>Street Bikes are, as revealed by their name completely street oriented. the motorcycles are at home on a racetrack and are the fastest, and most road capable of all the categories.
Street bikes are also typically the most expensive of the bunch to do any sort of high performance modifications to. Note that typically these motorcycles are also going to have the most 'agressive' rider geometry, also known as the <strong>Rider triangle</strong>
